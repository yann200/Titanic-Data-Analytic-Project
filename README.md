# Titanic-Data-Analytic-Project



## Problem Statement

Goal: See if survival rate had anything to do with the passanger class. Also, assess the age of the passengers within each class to identify vulnerable age categories.

Assessment: The data analytics dashboard reveals significant differences in survival rates among various passenger classes on the Titanic. When examining the survival percentages, a substantial disparity is evident. First-class passengers had almost three times the survival rate compared to third-class passengers. This underscores the importance of analyzing survival percentages rather than merely the total number of survivors.

For first-class passengers, the survival rate is approximately 60%. However, when considering the percentage of survivors within each class, the rate is notably higher, emphasizing the critical need to differentiate between overall survival rates and class-specific survival percentages.

Age also played a significant role in survival outcomes. Second-class children had a 100% survival rate, compared to 80% for first-class and 40% for third-class children. No seniors survived in the second and third classes, while only 17% (one individual) survived in the first class. It is essential to conduct a deeper statistical analysis for the first class result to determine if this survival rate among seniors is statistically significant or due to chance.
